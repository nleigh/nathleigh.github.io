					<h3>Technological Unemployment </h3>
					
					<p>
					
					Some economic experts see the new robotic and automation capabilities and are
					not worried, they say nothing is new and use history to show how technology 
					has always replaced the jobs it destroys with more and better jobs. 
					They have valid arguments, no one can predict what new jobs will be created,
					just like how 50 years ago no one predicted the internet and the amount of 
					jobs that it would create.  
					</p><p>
					
					Some technology experts believe that this time new jobs will not be created 
					quickly enough to replace the destroyed jobs. They believe job creation 
					will no longer be able to keep up with the exponential trend of Morse Law
					which is why some experts argue that this time, it’s different.
					</p><p>
					
					What is certain that humans have a limited skill set and each year robots are 
					gaining them and improving upon them due to

					exponentially
					</span>
					<span class="tooltip-content clearfix">
					
					<span class="tooltip-text">
					<strong>Exponential - </strong>
					
					Ask someone how long a million seconds is - the answer is 12 days. 
					Ask them to think how long a billion seconds is and they may well 
					answer in days. The answer is 32 years.
					People struggle with large numbers so it’s no surprise exponential 
					is hard to grasp for some.
					<br>
					After 30 linear steps I’d end up 30 paces or 30 meters away.
					But if I said to you take 30 exponential steps, one, two, four,
					eight, sixteen, thirty-two... you would end up a billion meters away,
					which is twenty-six times around the planet.

					will see huge disruption in the very near future.

					that will appear in the next 2 decades,

					Is a 100% employment rate really humanity's end goal? Should we still

					In these difficult times, we see many struggling, including hard-working families,
					with the cost of living crisis across the UK today. That is why I want to focus on
					one of the obstacles to fairness: the pay gap between the bosses of Britain’s
					biggest companies and their average employees, which has become even greater 
					over the past couple of years.

					are one of the key drivers of inequality and how to address 
					this issue with a Maximum wage solution. 
					</p><p><i>
					“At Associated British Foods, the gap between the pay of the chief
					executive and the average worker’s salary was 361 times. In the hospitality conglomerate
					Whitbread, the gap was 415 times. Worst of all was the pay gap at the media company WPP,
					where the CEO took home a pay package nearly 800 times bigger 
					than his employees.<br>
					Perhaps we should raise the idea of a maximum pay ratio, so that the highest paid 
					employee of an organisation would not be allowed to earn more than a fixed multiple 
					of the amount earned by lowest paid. 

					</p><p>
					Would a democratically enacted maximum pay ratio of, for example, 75:1 really be that
					extreme in a society that uses zero-hours contracts and relies on food banks?
					Some forward-looking organisations already operate such a policy unilaterally; 
					for example, John Lewis has capped the ratio at 75:1 and the TSB at 65:1”
					</i>
					</p><p>
				
					 A maximum pay ratio would recognise the important
					principle that all workers should share in a company’s success, this would also
					reduce the gaps between those at the top and low and middle earners.
					The High Pay centre have released a

					<strong>High Pay Centre - </strong>
					<a href="
					http://highpaycentre.org/blog/reform-agenda-how-to-make-top-pay-fairer" target="_blank">
					Typical annual pay for a FTSE 100 CEO has risen from around £100- £200,000 
					in the early 1980s to £4.3 million in 2012. This represented a leap from
					around 20 times the pay of the average UK worker in the 1980s to 160 times in 2012
					</a>
					</span></span></span>
					
					on how to make top pay fairer,
					the report found that 78% of the public would support a maximum limit on the 
					amount the highest-paid employee of a company can be paid in relation to the lowest-paid.
					The government needs to enforce these policies to reduce income and wealth inequality.
					</p><p>
					
					Thankfully there is already a successful business model which adopts a fair wage ratio 
					between workers called Worker Cooperatives that the government should encourage more.
					Worker Cooperatives have company-wide profit-sharing so that all employees benefit
					proportionally from a company’s success, they have a maximum pay ratio meaning that
					executives cannot earn more than a certain multiple of their lowest-paid employee.
					Worker Cooperatives are a democratic organisation, each employee own the company 
					so employees each have a democratic voice in how the company is run.
					</p>
					<strong>Worker Cooperatives</strong>
					
					<p>
					The <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/mar/07/mondragon-spains-giant-cooperative">Mondragon Corporation</a>
					
					is a corporation and federation of worker cooperatives
					based in the Basque region of Spain, It is the world's biggest workers co-operative
					with annual sales over £13 billion ($19.44 billion). At the end of 2013, 
					it employed 74,061 people in 257 companies and organizations in four areas 
					of activity: finance, industry, retail and knowledge.
					</p><p>
					At Mondragon, there are agreed-upon wage ratios between executive work 
					and field or factory work which earns a minimum wage. These ratios range
					from 3:1 to 9:1 in different cooperatives and average 5:1. 
					That is, the general manager of an average Mondragon cooperative earns
					no more than 5 times as much as the theoretical minimum wage paid in his/her cooperative. 
					Economist Richard D Wolff gives a fantastic lecture to help people 
					<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKbukSeZ29o"target="_blank">understand</a> 				
					how the  Mondragon Worker Cooperative Corporation works. 
					
					
					</p><p>
					They are a Democratic organisation, Its worker members own MCC(Mondragon Cooperative Corporation)
					collectively and make all its basic decisions, no private or individual ownership of 
					MCC exists. In the MCC, the worker-members exercise the final power over capital 
					(machines, technology, cash, investments). They are not just, as in capitalism, 
					“the workers.” The managers each have one share, like the workers; because the
					workers outnumber the managers and democratic votes settle all matter, 
					the workers can fire the managers, not the other way around. 
					
					</p><p>
					The greatest responsibility of the worker-owner is participation in 
					
					
					<span class="tooltip tooltip-effect-1">

					decision making.

					<strong>Decision Making. - </strong>
					<a href="
					http://www.democracyatwork.info/studies/mondragon/" target="_blank">
					Worker-members vote on their individual cooperative’s direct management and internal affairs.
					They do the same for the MCC as a corporation by means of (1) democratically 
					electing representatives to the Co-operative Congress and (2) voting on 
					referenda that the Congress submits for worker-members’ approval. 

					</a>
					</span></span></span>
					The MCC mandate of ‘one worker, one vote’ applies to decision-making 
					in each individual cooperative enterprise and at the corporate level of MCC.
					
					Major issues decided by democratic ballots there include the election of Governing Council members.
					It is explicitly stated that the interests of MCC worker-members are
					to be the paramount criterion for deciding all decisions and actions. 
					
					</p><p>
					The Mondragon Worker Cooperative Corporation has showed remarkable resistance
					to abandoning its basic commitments through six decades of challenges and adjustments 
					to economic changes. It demonstrates – indeed, proves - the possibility, the durability, 
					the relative efficiency and competitive success of cooperative enterprises that
					should be recognized, commended, and replicated on a global scale.

					<a href="https://party.coop/2015/02/13/british-public-backs-co-operative-party-call-to-build-a-john-lewis-economy/"target="_blank">plans </a>

					of the people currently employed in the UK. Office for National
					Statistics figures on company size suggest there are 36,000 companies with 50
					or more employees in the UK, employing a total of 12.9 million people.
					At one FTSE 100 company, 
					the profit share for the average worker could be almost £4,000 per year.

					The government needs to encourage more companies and entrepreneurs to follow

					https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3JsIyVXmww&feature=youtu.be&t=36m1s" target="_blank">
					This cracked podcast segment explains the reasoning 
					behind a basic income perfectly.
					</a>
					</span></span></span>
					behind basic income is that even if you can't find work,
					even if you don't want to work, at least you can still function as
					a human being and have an income, it means every citizen has a right
					to a minimum level of subsistence.
					</p><p>
					
					People hear this and its met with cries of outrage at the suggestion 
					of giving people money for no reason. They believe it will be the end 
					of society because why would anyone do any work if you can just sit at
					home and get a cheque? <br>
					Yet we don't have enough jobs now, so if someone doesn't want a job and 
					just sits at home they have just freed up a job for someone who wants one.
					The people who can't work can still keep buying things, 
					the money is going to be spent, not saved, it gets injected right back into the economy.
					</p><p>
					
					People will say society will grind to a halt yet 
					<a href="http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/dcp171778_363998.pdf"target="_blank">currently </a>
					22.1% of people aged 16 to 64 are not in the labour force and productivity still keeps going up, 
					the stuff we want is still getting done but with less labour being put in,
					In the 1960s, only one in 20 American men between 25 and 54 was not working. 
					According to Mr Summers’s 
				<a href="http://www.economist.com/news/briefing/21594264-previous-technological-innovation-has-always-delivered-more-long-run-employment-not-less"target="_blank">extrapolations,</a>
					in ten years the number could be one in seven. Currently 13 people can

					enough cotton for 9.4 million T-shirts.
					<br>
					If less people are required to make the things we need then surely thats a good thing for society? 
					</p><p>
					We have a system to give money to people but we have to disguise it as payments in a
					series of ways to make them socially acceptable, we don't have a flat rate that 
					says this is least you can get and if you want anymore you have to work. 
					What we do instead is invent a hundred different politically correct ways 
					to send people money, you can get it if you are sick, a child, a veteran, old, 
					disabled, and you can't just get money, you have to specify its for buying
					food with

					 25 to 64 would get £65.45 and

					The only solution that I see is a shrinking work week. We may perhaps be working

					the prices of necessities and of what we today consider luxury goods dropping

					<h3>Conclusion</h3>
						<p>
						This section is the longest on this website because I believe this is the 
						most important in determining a future which is good for all.
						The hope of abundance  is obstructed by this problem as well as housing,
						every other necessity looks solvable thanks to technology.
						</p><p>
						What may be required eventually is a completely different system in the future, 
						just like how the people revolted to get rid of feudalism, 
						the same might happen to capitalism if current trends continue. 
						An Economist Thomas Piketty, released a best selling book last year called 
						<a href="http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/apr/28/thomas-piketty-capital-surprise-bestseller"target="_blank">Capital.</a>
						
						Piketty's argument is that, in an economy where the rate of return on capital
						outstrips the rate of growth, inherited wealth will always grow faster
						than earned wealth. <i>
						“If you get slow growth alongside better financial returns, then inherited
						wealth will, on average, dominate wealth amassed from a lifetime's labour
						by a wide margin", says Piketty. “Wealth will concentrate to levels
						incompatible with democracy, let alone social justice.
						 Capitalism, in short, automatically creates levels of inequality
						 that are unsustainable. The rising wealth of the 1% is neither a blip,
						 nor rhetoric.”		</i>				
						</p>
					
					
					
					<p>
						
					The future is not set in stone; it depends on the social and political choices
					that we make. This is a turning point in humanity and it could very much lead 
					to Star Trek type utopia but the current trend is all the technological gains
					and wealth that is generated is not being shared equally. 
					There are solutions but implementing them will not be easy but it will cause much greater 
					difficulty in the long run if nothing is done.
					If we do not adjust the current system quickly to cope with the job loses 
					and uneven distribution of wealth and income then this
